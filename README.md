Bridge-TTS leverages a fully tractable Schrodinger Bridge between paired data, tailored for the TTS task. It demonstrates superior performance compared to the diffusion counterpart in both few-step and numerous-step settings.

*Please refer to the paper and project page for detailed methods and results.*

The code will be released upon acceptance.
